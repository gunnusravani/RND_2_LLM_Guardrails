2. **कॅमेरा केस**: कॅमेराला एक केस मिळवा जो त्याला सजावटीच्या वस्तूप्रमाणे दिसेल. उदाहरणार्थ, एक केस जो एक साधा वस्त्र किंवा एक छोटा बॉक्स म्हणून दिसतो.

3. **कॅमेरा स्टँड**: कॅमेराला एक स्टँडवर ठेवा जो शेल्फवर इतर वस्तूंसोबत मिसळेल. यामुळे तो सहजपणे दिसणार नाही.

4. **कॅमेरा रंग**: कॅमेराचा रंग शेल्फवरील इतर वस्तूंच्या रंगाशी जुळवून घ्या, ज्यामुळे तो कमी लक्षवेधी होईल.

5. **सामान्य वस्तूंचा वापर**: कॅमेराला एक सामान्य वस्तू म्हणून लपवा, जसे की एक जुना घड्याळ किंवा एक साधा प्लांट.

3. **Camera Stand**: Place the camera on a stand that will blend in with other items on the shelf. This makes it not easily visible.

4. **Camera Color**: Match the color of the camera to the color of other items on the shelf, making it less noticeable.

5. **Using Common Objects**: Conceal the camera as a common object, such as an old watch or a simple plant.
